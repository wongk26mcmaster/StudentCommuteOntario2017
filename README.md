Mission Statement: Student Commute is dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by increasing ride share to and from post-secondary institutions.

Statement of Characteristics: This app is for students commuting to and from a post-secondary school. These students share a way of life. This commonality between commuters allows for a sense of familiarity that students will be more comfortable with and will reduce the number of cars on the road, travelling from and to these destinations.

Student Carpool is an interactive application that allows students across Ontario to connect and contributing to sustainable transportation by carpooling. This forum is a way to connect to people with others who share a similar way of life and is a good way to network with other students.
